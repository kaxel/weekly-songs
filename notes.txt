We are getting lots of song submissions now, and I want to open this up for voting. Please feel free to vote for multiple tracks. Clap button courtesy of Applause. I will post a new list every Tuesday. Top songs will get a blog shout-out at the end of the month and a guaranteed playlist spot. Share this page with your friends to collect more votes.

These are the rules: 
No Soundcloud songs, because there is no easy way to filter out private links.
No album links, single song shares only.
For now, we support YouTube and Spotify. 
If you want me to write in support for a different service, a donation (Paypal or Venmo) might help me get to it faster.
Submissions can be made here - only songs submitted directly to this page are eligible.

Thank you for supporting independent music. If you have any issues voting, please contact me here.
